Fixed some generator issues and split generator into:
* Licenses
* Permits

## Nov 24, 2010

The generator has now been tested with Rails 3.0.3 and works. Previously there was an issue with missing generator dependencies in the Rakefile.
Dependencies in general have been updated and the generator improved. 
Specs have been created for all the ORMs supported.

The API specs are now stored in spec/generic/api. To spec that an ORM implementation of cancan-permits work, simply require the 'xgroup_orm' file from the /basic and /owner
API folders. See current specs for various ORMs for how to do this. In special cases, override the configuration methods present in fx basic/config.rb and owner/config.rb

* Added support for Simply Stored ORM that can be used with Couch DB.

See specs in /simply_stored folder. It took only about 2 minutes to create this support, demonstrating how easy it now is to add support for new ORMs and data stores :)
