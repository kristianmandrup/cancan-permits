"Custom actions linked to objects":https://github.com/kristianmandrup/cream/issues/23

I think that in the cream/cancan world, what you try to achieve would require custom actions and "action groups" IMO.
So an _:admin_ license could be defined that allow _:publish_ and _:maintain_ actions (custom defined actions) to be applied on a certain kinds of objects (Classes). A Role can be granted this license through a Permit and a user be granted this role.
Then apply the following access logic:

<pre>
can? :administrate, Project do
...
can? :publish, Project do
   # publish section
end

can? :maintain, Project do
   # maintenance section
end

end 
</pre>

Then _:administrate_ could somehow be set up to point to a group of actions, in this case _:publish_ and _:maintain_ actions and the can? _:administrate_ test should only be valid if the user _can?_ both _:publish_ and _:maintain_ the object. Nice!
